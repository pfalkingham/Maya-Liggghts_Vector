# Maya-Liggghts_Vector
Matlab GUI script to transfer motion from Maya to Liggghts

This version uses proximal and distal end points of segments to calculate rotations. WARNING, SOME LONG AXIS ROTATION IS LOST (I'm working on a better version, but it's a way off yet - perhaps I'll branch it).


**Input files**

Exported translation/rotation from maya using XROMM toolkit.

See instructions guide for usage.
